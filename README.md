# Ergobook
The ergonomic notebook for students

## What is Ergobook?
As you may have inferred it from the name, Ergobook is a note-taking application designed to be as ergonomic as possible based on the known needs of students and academics across the world. The purpose of this project, beyond writing software for the sake of creation, is to improve the workflows of students in their best interest for academic success. Simply put, we're here to help students!

## Why build Ergobook?
I firmly believe that knowledge should be put to use for the benefit of humanity. With the help of my skills, my knowledge, and the support of those around me in my position as a student, I devote my skills to the development of solutions for peers and academics alike.
